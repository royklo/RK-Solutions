# RK-Solutions Repository
This repository serves as a central hub that redirects you to various tools, reports, and scripts I've developed. Currently, it contains redirects to my other GitHub repositories and PowerShell Gallery scripts, but in the future it will expand to include remediation scripts, functions, and many more resources.

## Larger Projects
For more comprehensive solutions, check out these standalone repositories:

- [ASR Rule Inspector](https://github.com/royklo/ASR-Rule-Inspector) - PowerShell script designed to inspect and report on Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules, Controlled Folder Access (CFA) configurations, and Intune policy assignments
- [Deploy Language Packs](https://github.com/royklo/DeployLanguagePacks) - PowerShell script automates the installation and configuration of language packs on Windows devices. It supports both manual language selection and automatic detection based on the user's public IP address.
